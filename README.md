## by (Valentine Ezenwanne)

## Project Objective
- The Objective of the project is to analyze a quarter worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine.


## Dataset

The dataset consits of two csv files that contain informations on the order_details and menu. T


The dataset can be found in the repository https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground




## Tools used
- Data cleaning: Pandas
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib and seaborn



## Key Insights for Presentation

### Recommended Analysis
- What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?

- What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?

- Were there certain times that had more or less orders?

- Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?



# Summary of findings
The orders are generally the same, except for February where there is an 8.7% drop, which steps up in March

Hamburger is the most ordered. The business should consider dropping the least ordered item; the Chicken tacos

### Highest Spend Orders
- The top 5 highest spend orders were between $185 - $192.
- Each of the four top spend orders contained 14 menu items, while one had 13 menus

### Peak Hours
There are four peak order hours: 12pm, 1pm, 5pm, and 6pm. These hours account for 45% of the total orders and as such the business should focus more on these hours and have the manpower to fulfill the orders

### Recommendation
Based on the orders and revenue, these menu items Hamburger & Cheeseburger (American), Korean beef bowl & Tofu pad Thai (Asian), Spaghetti & Meatballs (Italian), and Steak Torta (Mexican) are menus worth keeping and developing in each cuisine

The Italian Cuisine is the most ordered category among our top spend customers, so the business should focus on developing its menus
